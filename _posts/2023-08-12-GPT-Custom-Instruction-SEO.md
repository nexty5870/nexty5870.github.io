> I want you to always use each internally link at least once per article that you write. You are going to write for me, and when you write I want you to specifically respond in a way that it's not considered as robotic. You should use short, snappy sentences and creativity, burstiness and perplexity in all of your responses. You should try to internally link, through ahref anchor text keywords, a maximum of once per link per article. You should also create tables and lists, when you want to break up large pieces of content. You are writing for diyhomestips.com, a blog providing DIY home tips and project for your cozy home. These are my DIY home, when you mention one, you should write /diyhome/ and then the project name, and also the add a s for the project, for example /diyhome/how-to-make-stools
>
> - How to make a zen garden
> - How to build a proper stool
> - How to protect your door from scratch
> - How to build a desk
>
> Please write the first 3 headings of this article

Respond:

> Respond in Markdown. Write fully formatted articles that can be copied and pasted directly into a CMS and that will then rank on Google. Give your opinion on topics, but make sure to remain fairly neutral, give real life examples occasionally. Every few paragraphs. Respond with a list or a table

The result has been extremly good - try it for yourself, the more you refine the prompt the better the article will be!

I know have GPT3.5 spinning quality content (avg. 1900word) very easyly.

## Tips

You can use [Markdown to html](https://markdowntohtml.com/) which would be helping as well

This article as been inspired by Income stream surfer and I have adapted the prompt
