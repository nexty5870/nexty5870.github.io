## What is Buildspace?

[Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) is an online bootcamp that teaches you how to build a SaaS product. The bootcamp is 6 weeks long and you will learn how to build a SaaS product from scratch. I will learn how to build the frontend, backend, database, authentication, payment, etc. You will also learn how to deploy your app and how to market it.

I have apply to the S4 without knowing I would made it, according to the Livestream (decission day) there was more then 15000 application I'm really happy to be part of the S4 and I'm looking forward to learn a lot.

The onboarding is happening this Saturday and I'm really looking forward to it! For 6 weeks I will be focusing on a new sideproject.

## The Sideproject

I have currently submit an idea for a community website where people could share their Desk Setup, people could upvote and a leaderboard would be build. Each user could provide their link to the product (affiliate link I guess that how I would attract user to submit their setup).[DeskSpace](https://twitter.com/ShvZFR/status/1644998022336598018)

I'm not yet sure if the idea would be validated however I do see a big potential and depth into the project. I'm looking forward to see what the community think about it.

## Tech Stack

The Tech stack would be my usual T3 ยง(NextJS / Prisma / tRPC / TailwindCSS) with Supabase as the database. I'm looking forward to learn more about Supabase or maybe planete scale?
