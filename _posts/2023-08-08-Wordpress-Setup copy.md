# Wordpress setup for Programmatic SEO

I will go through the steps I took to setup my wordpress blog for programmatic SEO. I will also share the plugins I use and the theme I use. this is more an article for me to remember and refer back in time if needed, but if you discover this article and it helps you, then I'm glad it did.

## Step 1: Install Wordpress

I will not go through the steps of installing wordpress, there are plenty of articles out there that explain how to do it. I use Hostinger for my hosting, this is simple enough, I won't go through the setup. I also use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to manage my DNS and SSL certificates.

## Step 2: Install a theme

I use [GeneratePress](https://generatepress.com/) as a theme, it's a free theme that is very light and easy to use. I also use the [GenerateBlocks](https://generateblocks.com/) plugin to help me with the layout of my pages. I use the [GeneratePress Premium](https://generatepress.com/premium/) version as well, it's a one time fee of 59$ and it's worth it. I use it to customize my theme and add some features to it.

## Step 3: Install plugins

I use the following plugins:

- [RankMath](https://rankmath.com/) for SEO - I know people also use Yoast, but I prefer RankMath as it submit directly to google console upon submitting a new article

- [WP Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me/) for caching - I use the premium version, it's a one time fee of 49$ and it's worth it. I use it to speed up my website and it's very easy to use.

- [Bulk Delete](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-delete/) to delete posts in bulk - I use it to delete all the default posts that come with wordpress

- [Bulk Edit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-edit/) to edit posts in bulk - I use it to edit the default posts that come with wordpress

- [Bulk categories](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-categories/) to add categories in bulk - I use it to add categories in bulk

- [Bulk status](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-status/) to change status in bulk - I use it to change status in bulk

- [Auto Featured Image](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-featured-image-from-title/) to generate featured images - I use it to generate featured images for my posts ( I know there is some AI plugins that can do that, I need to check those)

- [Broken link checker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/) to check for broken links - I use it to check for broken links on my website

- [Site kit by Google](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/) to connect to google services - I use it to connect to google services

- [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) to edit pages - I use it to edit pages

## Article, get the juice

[Machined.ai](https://machined.ai) which is a paid AI blog writter costing 49$ per month. I'm planning to use it for the niche blog I'm building. I will write an article about it once I have enough content to share.
