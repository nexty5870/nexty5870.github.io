    "snippet": "IntroductionI have came accross domain flipping recently and I find it really fascinating. Ever heard of domain flipping? It’s a bit like house flipping, but instead of bricks and mortar, we’re dealing with web addresses. The big question on everyone’s lips is: can you flip domains in 30 days or less? Let’s dive in and find out!Understanding Domain FlippingSo, what exactly is domain flipping? In its simplest form, it’s buying a domain name at a low price and selling it at a higher price. Just like that antique vase you bought at a yard sale and sold on eBay!The potential profits can be huge. I once bought a domain for $10 and sold it for $1000, that’s a 9900% profit! But remember, it’s not always that easy. There are risks involved and not every domain will be a gold mine.The Importance of Domain Name SelectionChoosing the right domain name is crucial. It’s like picking a racehorse, you want one that’s going to win the race, not finish last.When selecting a domain name, consider its relevance, simplicity, uniqueness, and potential value. I always keep a notepad handy to jot down any ideas that pop into my head. You never know when inspiration will strike!There are also tools available that can help you find available domains based on popular keywords. I personally like using NameMesh and LeanDomainSearch.The Domain Buying ProcessBuying a domain is as easy as pie. There are many platforms out there like GoDaddy and Namecheap where you can buy domains.Just remember to do your homework before making a purchase. I once bought a domain without checking its history, only to find out it had been blacklisted by search engines. Lesson learned!Determining the Value of a DomainDetermining the value of a domain can be tricky. It’s influenced by many factors including length, keywords, and brandability.There are tools like EstiBot and GoDaddy’s Domain Appraisal tool that can give you an estimated value. But take these with a grain of salt, they’re not always accurate. Trust your gut and use your best judgment.The Domain Selling ProcessOnce you’ve bought a domain, it’s time to sell it. Platforms like Flippa and Sedo are great for this.Setting a competitive price and effectively marketing your domain can help speed up the selling process. I once sold a domain in just a week by sharing it in a niche forum!Flipping Domains in 30 Days: Is it Possible?So, can you flip domains in 30 days or less? The short answer is: Yes, it’s possible, but it’s not guaranteed.Just like any business, domain flipping requires patience and persistence. But with the right strategies and a bit of luck, you can make a quick profit. Remember, it’s all about buying low and selling high.ConclusionDomain flipping can be a profitable venture if you’re willing to put in the time and effort. And yes, it’s possible to flip domains in 30 days or less, but don’t count on it every time.Remember to choose your domains wisely, buy at the right price, and sell where your audience is. Happy flipping!Additional ResourcesIf you want to learn more about domain flipping, there are plenty of resources available. Websites like NamePros and DNForum have great communities where you can learn from experienced domain flippers. You’ve got this!"

    "snippet": "IntroI’ve started some home automation recently, and I’ve also been testing octoprint ( I have it installed back in the day but was not super happy with the performance ( disconnection / lag ) - I decided to swap my SD card and use a proper 3A USB power plug and since then I’m please with my Octoprint setup), As I said on top - I’ve started to get some home automation done in the appartment using Alexa and some smart plug. In this How to, I’ll be explaining how to integrate a smart plug from TPlink (not super expensive) in order to have your printer to shutdown once finish, you’ll see that super easy.Step 1Get the Smart Plug from TPLink, it’s would be possible to have it done like DIY but for 35euros, we will save time, have a more reliable setting and the hassle of the setup. On top of that you can always shutdown the printer even if you’re not at home from the TP Link application.To setup the plug that super easy, you’ll have to download the TP Link application iOS link/Android link - Once installed on your phone, plug your Smart Plug into the power socket, launch the APP and follow the instruction to connect the Plug to your home network, it won’t take long.Once done we will have to find the IP details of your plug, you can do that by going under your router page and check for the DHCP  IP that was given by your router itself - or you can use an app on your phone called Fing iOS / Fing Android this app will scan your network and discover for you all the devices plugged into your network - the plug will be listed (I still recommand checking the router page as you can validate the IP by checking the mac address details of the plug ( this is a physical address that attributed to the device itself by the manufacturer))Once this is done you can move to Step2. But before that - you can connect the power cord of your printer in your smartplug and turn the power supply of your printer to ON position.Step 2You would need to install Octoprint TP Link plugin, for that head over the wrench on the top right cornerOnce there, go to your Plugin ManagerClick on Get More and search for TP Link SmartPlug, you can install it and you will have to reload when prompt by octoprintOnce Octoprint is reloaded, go back to your parameter and under plugins on the left you should see something called TP-Link smartplugClick on that and click on the little pencil to edit the plug - You will have to enter the IP of your SmartPlug &amp; a Label - you will also have to click on GCODE Trigger as per the screenshot below (please note that your IP should be different then mine)At this stage, your setup is almost finish, you can now try to turn on the printer by pressing the little Bolt on topIt should light Green or Red depending of the state of the printer, you should have the printer turning ON or OFF - you would need to trigger the power button to ON in your printer in order to have it working properly, remember the plug will allow the voltage to flow to the printer moving forward!FINAL STEP 3!Step 3 ( Cura )Remember we had check the GCODE Trigger activate in the Step 2 - This will allow to trigger ON or OFF the printer by having a new ending script GCODE line, M81 follow by the IP of the smartplug will allow you to shutdown the printer once the print is finishif you’re using Cura, please head under your Printer ending script settings located under: Settings &gt; Printer &gt; Manage Printer &gt; Choose your printer and hit Machine settingsOnce you are on your machine settings, you can then add a M81  ( remove the &lt;&gt; ) under the End G-code section same as the screen below but remember to match with your current IP and **voila** 🤩Step 3 (Simplify 3D)If you’re using Simplify 3D - same step apply, but in different location, Edit your Process by double clicking on itGo Under: Scripts &gt; Ending Scripts In order to add the M81  LineDo not forget to save/Update your profile and and Voila 🤩ConclusionThis is a good addition to Octoprint in effort to make your setup more efficient and silent, why would the printer run all night if you’re print finish at 2AM and you’re sleeping?happy printing! 😀"

    "snippet": "IntroductionYou might have seen one of my Instagram post lately Here but I’ve basically started working on a Remote for a future robot’s. Not sure where this will go but I’m aiming to start a YouTube Series where I build from scratch a robot, inspired by James Bruton and his opendog series ( Im not by all means at this level don’t get too excited ! 🤩 )Where am at ?By no means I can ( yet ) write a piece of Arduino code by myself, however if the base code is there, I can tweak most of the code for my need, and so far that feel good. I never used the servo library before, however I’ve manage to setup a reset function using the switch on the joystick, without reading any information online, and manage to print the servo PWM on the serial. Doesn’t seem a lot to you but that the begining in terms of code, I’d like in future to be able to write code myself and feel comfortable showing/explaining that on my YouTbe ChannelCodeBelow is the code I’m currently at, the speed for the X servo need a bit of tweaking we can feel that the incremential is not smooth enough but that was just a test for the reset function - the code is not the clearest but again this is a start of the learning#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;Servo servo1;Servo servo2;int x_key = A1;                                               int y_key = A0;int reset_pin = 10;                                              int x_pos;int y_pos;int reset_pos;int servo1_pin = 8;int servo2_pin = 9;  int initial_position = 90;int initial_position1 = 90;void setup ( ) {Serial.begin (9600) ;servo1.attach (servo1_pin ) ;servo2.attach (servo2_pin ) ;servo1.write (initial_position);servo2.write (initial_position1);pinMode (x_key, INPUT) ;                     pinMode (y_key, INPUT) ;pinMode (reset_pin, INPUT);digitalWrite(reset_pin, HIGH);}void loop ( ) {x_pos = analogRead (x_key) ;  y_pos = analogRead (y_key) ;reset_pos = analogRead (reset_pin) ;                      Serial.println(digitalRead(reset_pin));if (x_pos &lt; 300){if (initial_position &lt; 10) { } else{ initial_position = initial_position - 50; servo1.write ( initial_position ) ; delay (50) ; } } if (x_pos &gt; 700){if (initial_position &gt; 180){  }  else{initial_position = initial_position + 20;servo1.write ( initial_position ) ;delay (50) ;}}if (y_pos &lt; 300){if (initial_position1 &lt; 10) { } else{ initial_position1 = initial_position1 - 50; servo2.write ( initial_position1 ) ; delay (50) ; } } if (y_pos &gt; 700){if (initial_position1 &gt; 180){  }        else{initial_position1 = initial_position1 + 50;servo2.write ( initial_position1 ) ;delay (50) ;}}if (digitalRead (reset_pin) == 0){  servo1.write ( initial_position1);  servo2.write ( initial_position);  delay (50) ;}}I had to add a reset position variable in order to call the function as well, this look easy enough but for a Arduino rookie like me it feel good to have it nailed down to do what it suppose to do, meaning reseting the servo position to neutral/centerWhat next?The next step would be to work on some Bluetooth communication and add a screen with menu option - this is just a start, I haven’t decide on which platform to go for the robot nor the functionality but will see how that goes I believe, hit me up with some suggestion if you have any on the platform or functionality"

    "snippet": "IntroThe Nanoleaf clone project would be the first project to be on the blog. If you don’t know what the Nanoleaf is, I’ll recommand you clicking on that linkPretty good connected devices that can add some atmosphere to your rooms, down side is that it’s fairly expensive ( the design is worth it )I’ve came across this thing link thing:3230905 and I though it’s a pretty good idea for Xmas!I had some Led and NodeMCU available and decided to take onboard on the project. I’m still having some pannel that currently printing ( I’m doing a 20 triangle panel size )HardwareYou might have seen the picture, the most time consuming in this project ( but still fun! ) is the soldering/cable management, I’ve come up using my male to male servo lead 150mm long ( which is the perfect size for the project ) - bellow is the part list:  Aliexpress - Servo lead 150mm  Aliexpress - Pin header  Amazon - WS2812B5 led 5m 60leds/m  Aliexpress - DC Male/Female plug  Aliexpress - 5V 3A AC/DC Adaptor  M5 screw ( 8mm looks perfect )Print partHere is the link to the thing used in this project thing:3230905 - Each triangle is taking approx 3h to print on my various printer (MK3 / JAurora / Ender 3 &amp; the CR20) printed at .2mm layer high, 30% infill, no support required and pretty easy printHere is the link to all the thingiverseNanoleaf replicaNanoleaf canvas cuttingBuildHere is some picture of the build, the video will be released once the project is fully doneI wanted to keep the build as clean as possible with the flexibility that Nanoleaf can offer by adding more triangle,I wanted my build to be a 20 triangles meaning a total of 120 leds and 360 Pin header the 3A power supply should be sufficient for project, below the picture of the preparationCodeHere is the code link, please remember to change your SSID and password in order to have it working, and the D4 is being used as pinout - if you have to change it for what ever reason do not forget to update the code, D4 is next to the GND and 5V which make it easier to hook up everything.
